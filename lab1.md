# Lab Report 1

## Testing out cd
![Image](cd1.PNG)

Since I was in a directory already, lecture1, with no argument inputed it would take me back to the orignal directory.

A directory input will take me into the directory

Since I inputted a class file, it is not a directory so the terminal will produce an error.

## Testing out ls

![Image](ls1.PNG)

Since there was no input it showed me all the available directories 

![Image](ls2.PNG)

With a directory input it gave me all the files within that current directory

A file input will give me the name of the file I selected

---
## Testing out cat
![Image](cat1.PNG)

Since I gave it no input, there will be nothing to concat so the script will break

![Image](cat2.PNG)

A directory input will return an error as it is unable to concat just a directory

![Image](cd3.PNG)

With two file inputs, they will be concated together and the terminal will print them after each other
