- The `handleRequest` method is being called
- The arguments here are `user` and `message` and when the URL receives the input from `/add-message/` it updates the field, `fullMessage`, combining them
- The parameters `user` and `message` can keep changing depending on what the user inputs into the URL which in turn will update `fullMessage`
