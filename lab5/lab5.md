Hello, I am currently trying to use `bash` to test `ListExamples.java`, however, I keep running into these error messages and I am unsure of what it is trying to ask me.

Hi Tam, 

It seems that the error that you are coming across is due to being in the wrong directory, try to `cd` out of `error` and then try to vim from there.

Hope this helps!

I just tried that and now it works, thank you so much!
