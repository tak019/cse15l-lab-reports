Hello, I am currently trying to use `bash` to test `ListExamples.java`, however every time I try to vim, it produces a blank document with no code on it.

Hi Tam, 

It seems that the error that you are coming across is due to being in the wrong directory, try to `cd` out of `error` and then try to vim from there.

Hope this helps!

I just tried that and now it works, thank you so much!
