Hello, I am currently trying to use `bash` to test `ListExamples.java`, however, I keep running into these error messages and I am unsure of what it is trying to ask me.

Hi Tam,

Would you provide me with your code so I can take a look at it?

Hi Tam, 

It seems that the error you are coming across relates to your grammar and logic within the code. I would advise you to double-check and make sure that all your words are written correctly. Also you should take a look at your first `result.add`. 
Hope this helps!

I just looked back and found the spelling errors and fixed the indexing for the `result.add`. Thank you so much!
